A time audit app.

## Motivation
Productivity begins with awareness.  
Before optimizing your schedule, you need to see your time clearly—like holding up a mirror to your day.

This isn’t just about tracking minutes. It’s about:

- Spotting hidden time leaks (30 mins here, 1 hour there)
- Freeing yourself from "busyness" illusions
- Designing a day that aligns with your priorities

Traditional methods fail because:  
❌ Manual tracking feels like clerical work  
❌ Digital tools miss offline life (coffee chats, notebooks, deep work)  

That’s why we’re rethinking time tracking—not as a chore, but as a lens for intentional living.
